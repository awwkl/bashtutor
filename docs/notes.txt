--- TODO ---
portability
    makefile uses cc compiler currently
error-checking
    for debugging
    useful error messages for users
keyboard support
    arrow keys to move up and down
    signal handling of Ctrl-C, etc (need to make decisions re this)
extensibility of chapters
    sizeof() operator to determine sizes of chapter arrays
optimizations and compilation optimizations 
    turn static functions into inline? does it make it faster?
-------------

Below is the structure for containing information text for explanations

<<directory structure>>
bashtutor.c
Makefile
info/chapter1.h
    /chapter2.h
        extern char *chapter2[]
    /chapter3.h

    /chapter1.c
    /chapter2.c
        char *chapter2[] = {"one" , "two", "threee"};
    /chapter3.c

<<info/chapter2.h>>
extern char *chapter2[];

<info/chapter2.c>
char *chapter2[] = {
"(200) first one\n",

"(201) The \"ls\" command is greatly useful for a few things: \n \
    - list directories\n \
    - list files\n \
    - multiple options\n"
};
